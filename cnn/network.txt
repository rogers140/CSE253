input 28*28 ->
convolution with filter size 5*5*1 and with relu activation ->
max_pooling within 2*2 region ->
convolution with filter size 3*3*5 and with relu activation ->
max_pooling with 2*2 region ->
fully connected with 2048 output units and with relu activation ->
output with 100 units, each unit corresponds to one class, use cross entropy loss
