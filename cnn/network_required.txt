input 28*28 ->
convolution with filter size 9*9*1*2 and with tanh activation ->
convolution with filter size 5*5*2*4 and with tanh activation ->
max_pooling with 4*4 region ->
fully connected with 30 output units and with tanh activation ->
output with 10 units, each unit corresponds to one class, use cross entropy loss
