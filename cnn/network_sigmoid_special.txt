input 28*28 ->
convolution with filter size 9*9*1*4 and with sigmoid activation ->
mean_pooling with 2*2 region ->
convolution with filter size 5*5*4*2 and with sigmoid activation ->
mean_pooling with 2*2 region ->
fully connected with 45 output units and with sigmoid activation ->
output with 10 units, each unit corresponds to one class, use cross entropy loss
